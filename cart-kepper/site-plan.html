                 I want it to have a checklist and make it as done. I also want it to keep track of what they buy so that you can rebuy them.
                also have it add suggestions.</p>

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>I know that this is something that moms and girls use. This is something that they made it was a piece of paper and then you forgot.

                <src href="https://api.bigoven.com/documentation/grocery-list ">https://api.bigoven.com/documentation/grocery-list </src> I'm might use this api to get the information for the list.

			<h3>[Page 2]</h3>
			<p> <img class="small-img" src="photos/shoping list.jpg" alt="page 2" /> As a college student I go shopping on my own all the time and I always forget what I needed to buy and forget something. It would be nice to be able to check it of and easyly at the store. This is what made me want to make it so that I can use it to be easier in my life but I feel like others think the same way. 
            Features:
            -search items
            -add it many times 
            -mark as done 
            -suggestions
            -and so much more </p>
			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>
				Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
				here
			</p>

			<h3>Home</h3>

			<p>
				the object will be things that you can search for and then show up and then you can add it. Then you can see the list and check it as done or not. Then you can add section just incase you forget something.
